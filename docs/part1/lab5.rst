Assignment 5: Slotted Pages
============================

In this lab, you will be implementing support for slotted pages.

Getting started
---------------

.. include:: ../shared/getting_started.rst

Description
---------------

Implement the *schema segment* and the *slotted pages*. In the schema
segment, you should store the segment ids of the free-space inventory
and the slotted page segment as well as the total number of existing
slotted pages and the schema string. The slotted page segment should
store slotted pages as discussed in the lecture. Your implementation
should support allocation, reading, writing, and resizing of records in
a page. You should also implement TID redirects and use a free-space
inventory to find suitable pages more efficiently.

``src/include/catalog/schema.h`` contains a simplified schema that you
should be able to serialize and deserialize into the schema segment. For
this purpose we also added the library *rapidjson*
(``vendor/rapidjson.cmake``) that you could use.

Important files for this assignment:

-  ``src/include/catalog/schema.h``

-  ``src/include/storage/segment.h``

-  ``src/include/storage/slotted_page.h``

-  ``src/storage/fsi_segment.cc``

-  ``src/catalog/schema.cc``

-  ``src/catalog/schema_segment.cc``

-  ``src/storage/slotted_page.cc``

-  ``src/storage/sp_segment.cc``

.. include:: ../shared/environment_setup.rst

Implementation Details
----------------

Add your implementation to the files ``src/include/catalog/schema.h``,
``src/catalog/schema.cc``, ``src/storage/sp_segment.cc`` and
``src/include/storage/segment.h``. All definitions for the methods that
you should implement are provided. You can add new member functions and
member variables to all classes as needed.

Your implementation should pass all tests starting with ``SegmentTest``.
We will of course check your code for correctness. Passing the tests is
a requirement but does not automatically mean that you will get full
points.

.. include:: ../shared/logistics.rst

Detailed Instructions
---------------------

Start the project by implementing ``SchemaSegment::read`` and
``SchemaSegment::write`` functions.

The schema segment should be structured as:

-  The segment id of the slotted pages segment

-  The segment id of the free-space inventory segment

-  The size of the slotted pages segment (in #pages)

-  The length of the serialized schema (in #bytes)

-  The serialized schema

Use `rapidjson <http://rapidjson.org/md_doc_schema.html>`__ to serialize
and deserialize.
``rapidjson::Document, rapidjson::Writer and rapidjson::Value`` are the
key APIs to look for in the documentation. Note that the serialized
schema *could* be larger than 1 page.

Once all the test cases with prefix schema pass, proceed to implement
the
``SPSegment::read, SPSegment::write, SPSegment::resize and SPSegment::allocate.``
High level description of each function is provided in ``segment.h``. To
simplify this lab, we have provided implementation of
``free-space inventory`` and ``slotted pages``. Before implementing
``SPSegment``, go through the available functions in ``FSISegment`` and
``SlottedPage``.
