Assignment 3: B+-Tree
=================================

For the third lab, you will implement the B+Tree data structure.

Getting started
---------------

**Start by downloading the code for lab 3 from Canvas.**

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, you will implement a B+-Tree index for your database using
the header ``src/include/index/btree.h``.
The B+-Tree must support the following operations: 

* ``lookup`` Returns a value or indicates that the key was not found. 
* ``insert`` Inserts a new key-value pair into the tree. 
* ``erase`` Deletes a specified key. You may simplify the logic by accepting under full pages.

You will use page ids and the buffer manager instead of pointers to
resolve child nodes in the tree. You can assume that the
``buffer_manager`` methods ``fix_page`` and ``unfix_page`` work as
described in the lecture. We added a fake buffer manager that allows you
to test your code without I/O, so you can focus only on implementing the
B+-Tree.    

Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index should be implemented as C++ template that accepts the
parameters **key type**, **value type**, **comparator** and **page
size**. Note that this task does not use a dynamic **page size** but
compile-time constants. You therefore have to implement the B+-Tree
primarily in the header ``src/include/index/btree.h`` but you are able
to compute a more convenient node layout at compile-time.

You can test your implementation using the tests in
``test/unit/index/btree_test.cc``. The tests will instantiate your
B+-Tree as ``BTree<uint64_t, uint64_t, std::less<uint64_t>, 1024>``.

Build instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter BuzzDB's directory and run

.. code-block:: sh

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

Test Instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the entire test suite, use:

.. code-block:: sh

    ctest

ctest has a flag option to emit verbose output. Please refer to `ctest
manual <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-1>`__.

We have provided all the test cases for this lab. Gradescope will only
test your code against these test-cases.

Similar to labs 1 and 2, your implementation will be checked for memory
leaks. You can check for memory leaks using valgrind.

.. code-block:: sh

    ctest -V -R btree_test_valgrind

Detailed Instructions
---------------------

Code structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will implement the B+-Tree in the ``src/include/index/btree.h``
file. You are provided with three functions in the skeleton code for the
three operations introduced above.

* ``std::optional<ValueT> lookup(const KeyT &key)`` - looks up and returns the value of the node with key specified by the parameter ``key``.
* ``void insert(const KeyT &key, const ValueT &value)`` - Inserts a new key-value pair specified by the parameters ``key`` and ``value`` into the tree. 
* ``void erase(const KeyT &key)`` - Deletes the key specified by the parameter ``key``.


In addition to these functions, we have also provided the skeleton code
for structures that represent different nodes in the B+-Tree:
 
* ``Node`` - This is the base structure for all the nodes in the B+-Tree.
* ``InnerNode`` - This structure should be used to represent the *inner* nodes of the tree. 
* ``LeafNode`` - This structure should be used to represent the *leaf* nodes of the tree.


Note that ``InnerNode`` and ``LeafNode`` inherit members from the base
``Node`` object.

Following are some of the important members from ``InnerNode`` and ``LeafNode`` that you will need to implement:

* ``static constexpr uint32_t kCapacity`` - The capacity of a node. 
* ``std::pair<uint32_t, bool> lower_bound(const KeyT &key)`` - Get the index of the first key that is not less than than a provided key. 
* ``void insert(const KeyT &key, uint64_t split_page)`` - Insert a key.
* ``KeyT split(std::byte* buffer)`` - Split the node.
* ``void erase(const KeyT &key)`` - Erase a key (Used only with leaf nodes).
* ``std::vector<KeyT> get_key_vector()`` - Returns the keys (Used only while testing your implementation). -
* ``std::vector<uint64_t> get_child_vector()`` - Returns the child page ids (Used only while testing your implementation).

Algorithmic details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a rough outline of the steps you need to follow to implement the
above methods.

-  Lookup

   1. Locate the leaf node corresponding to the key.

      1. Start with the root node.
      2. Is the current node a leaf?

      -  if yes, return the current page.
      -  if no, find next node to traverse (hint: use
         ``inner_node->lower_bound`` method).
      -  repeat b until leaf node is found.

   2. Once leaf node is found, find first entry â‰¥ search key (use
      *binary\_search*).
   3. If such entry is found, return it, else return no key is found.

-  Insert

   1. Create a new root if needed(code snippet provided).
   2. Locate the appropriate leaf page (same as step (i) in ``lookup``).
   3. Starting with the leaf node, execute the following actions.
   4. Is there free space on the node(leaf/inner)?

      -  If yes, insert entry and stop (use ``node->insert``).

   5. Split the node(leaf/inner) into two (use ``node->split`` method).
   6. Insert key into the appropriate node(leaf/inner).
   7. Insert return value of ``node->split`` as separator into parent.

      -  If the parent overflows, follow steps 4 through 7 on the parent
         node until node with free space is found.

   Note: If any node in the process does not have a parent, create new
   root and update its children.

-  Erase

   1. Lookup the appropriate leaf page (same as step 1 in ``lookup``).
   2. Remove the entry from the current page (use ``leaf_node->erase``
      method). (note that ``erase`` becomes lot easier in our case
      because we allow under full pages)

-  Capacity - Here, you will implement the logic to compute the capacity
   of a given node.

Logistics
---------

You must submit your code (see below) as well as an one-page writeup (in a file named `REPORT.md`) describing your solution. In the writeup, mention: (1) the design decisions you made, and (2) the missing components in your code. We will award partial credits based on this writeup (if you are unable to finish the implementation before the due date and/or if it fails any test cases).

Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is allowed.

Submitting your assignment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should submit your code as a zip file via Gradescope. We have set up an autograder that will test your implementation. You are allowed to make multiple submissions and we will use the latest submission to grade your lab.

.. code-block:: sh

  bash submit.sh <name>

> :warning: **WARNING** Do not add additional files to the zip file, use the ``submit.sh`` script.  


Grading
~~~~~~~

95% of your grade will be based on whether or not your code passes the autograder test suite. 5% is for code quality. We will award partial marks for submissions that fail the autograder test suite (based on the writeup).
