In this course, you will be building a toy database system, called **buzzdb**, 
in `C++ <https://en.cppreference.com/w/>`__.

These are the topics that we will cover in this course:

- `Setup Development Environment <setup.html>`__
- `Lab 1: External Sort <lab1.html>`__
- `Lab 2: Buffer Management <lab2.html>`__
- `Lab 3: B-Tree <lab3.html>`__
- `Lab 4: Query Execution <lab4.html>`__

These labs are derived from courses developed by 
`Thomas Neumann <https://db.in.tum.de/~neumann/?lang=en>`__ and
`Andy Pavlo <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/>`__.
